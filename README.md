# The RISE Self-Driving Model Vehicle Platform (SDVP)

This is the source code and hardware design for a model vehicle platform developed and maintained at RISE Research Institutes of Sweden. The platform currently has full support for cars with Ackermann steering and partial support for quadcopters.  

Figure 1 shows a screenshot of RControlStation, which is a GUI where model vehicles can be viewed and controlled in real time.

Currently a lot of documentation is missing, but this will be added over time along with tutorials on how to use this platform.
