# The RISE Self-Driving Model Vehicle Platform (SDVP)

This is the source code and hardware design for a model vehicle platform developed and maintained at RISE Research Institutes of Sweden. The platform currently has full support for cars with Ackermann steering and partial support for quadcopters.  

Figure 1 shows a screenshot of RControlStation, which is a GUI where model vehicles can be viewed, configured and controlled in real time.

Currently a lot of documentation is missing, but this will be added over time along with tutorials on how to use this platform. The content of the documentation directory is incomplete and out of date, so don't rely on it too much.
